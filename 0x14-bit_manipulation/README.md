BIT MANIPULATION
Bit manipulation is super fast and efficient, making it handy in programming. It's used for tasks like optimizing code, working with data compression, encryption, graphics, and more. It's like having a toolkit of tiny switches to solve big problems in computing.
Bit Manipulation: Turning Tiny Switches

In the world of computers, everything is made up of bits, which are like tiny switches that can be either on (1) or off (0). Bit manipulation is the art of using these switches to perform different tasks. Here's how it works:

1. Changing Individual Bits: You can change a specific bit in a number without affecting the others. It's like flipping a light switch in a room without touching the other switches.

2. Shifting Bits: You can move all the bits to the left or right. It's like sliding beads on an abacus. Shifting can make a number bigger or smaller.

3. Combining Bits: You can combine bits from two numbers using operations like AND, OR, and XOR. It's like mixing colors to create new shades.

4. Checking Bits: You can check if a particular bit is on or off. It's like asking if a specific light in a room is lit or not.

5. Setting Bits: You can turn on specific bits, setting them to 1. It's like flipping a light switch to brighten a room.

6. Clearing Bits: You can turn off specific bits, setting them to 0. It's like turning off lights to darken a room.

7. Masking Bits: You can use a mask, like a stencil, to keep some bits unchanged while modifying others. It's like painting only part of a picture.
