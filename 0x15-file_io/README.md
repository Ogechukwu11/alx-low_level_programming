FILE I/O

File I/O (Input/Output) is like reading and writing information on your computer. It's a way for computer programs to:
1. Read: Open files, like reading a book or a document.
2. Write: Create, modify, or save files, like writing notes.
3. Organize: Store and manage data in files, just like you organize your papers in folders.
In simple terms, File I/O is how programs interact with files, making them useful tools for tasks like storing documents, images, and more.
