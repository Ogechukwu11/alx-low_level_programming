Doubly Linked Lists In C

A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to both its predecessor and successor. Unlike a singly linked list, which only has a reference to the next element, a doubly linked list allows for easy traversal in both directions. Each element in a doubly linked list, commonly known as a node, contains data and two pointers—one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node.

To use a doubly linked list in C, start by defining a structure for the nodes. Each node should contain the data and two pointers—one for the previous node (prev) and another for the next node (next).
For instance:
struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node *prev;
	struct Node *next;
};
Understanding and implementing doubly linked lists in C can enhance your ability to manage dynamic data efficiently. These versatile structures allow bidirectional traversal and provide flexibility in various operations.
