# Make and Makefiles

## What is Make?

Make is a build automation tool that helps manage the build process of a software project. It uses Makefiles, which are plain text files containing rules and dependencies.

## Why Use Makefiles

Makefiles provide a structured way to define how your project should be built. They help automate repetitive tasks, manage dependencies, and ensure that only the necessary steps are executed.


# Rules

## Explicit and Implicit Rules

In Makefiles, rules define how to build a target. There are two types of rules: explicit and implicit.

- Explicit Rules: These specify how to generate a specific target file.
- Implicit Rules: These are predefined rules that specify how to generate a target based on its file extension.

## Setting and Using Rules

To set a rule, define the target, dependencies, and the commands to build the target. 
For example:
target: dependencies
    command1
    command2

Here, 'target' is what you're building, 'dependencies' are the prerequisites, and 'command1' and 'command2' are the steps to build the target.

## Common/Useful Rules

Highlight some of the most common and useful rules that you've implemented in your project. For example:

- 'all': Builds the entire project.
- 'clean': Removes generated files.
- 'install': Installs the project.
- 'test': Runs tests.

# Variables

## What are Variables

Variables in Makefiles allow you to define values that can be reused throughout the file. They enhance maintainability and flexibility.

## Setting and Using Variables

Define a variable using 'variable_name = value'. For example:

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2

target: dependencies
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o target dependencies

Here, CC is a variable representing the compiler, and CFLAGS represents compiler flags.
